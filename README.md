## Firebase Security Rules

The Firestore security rules ensure that only authenticated users can read or write data related to their own account.

```plaintext
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Match the inventory collection
    match /inventory/{userId}/{documentId} {
      // Allow read and write access only to the document owner
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Match the shoppingList collection
    match /shoppingList/{userId}/{documentId} {
      // Allow read and write access only to the document owner
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
